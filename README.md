# Iris-Flower_Classification
Iris Flower Classification:    This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica species based on sepal and petal measurements. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation (95% accuracy), and visualization with confusion matrices.

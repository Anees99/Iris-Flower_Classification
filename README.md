# Iris-Flower_Classification
Iris Flower Classification:    This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica species based on sepal and petal measurements. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation (95% accuracy), and visualization with confusion matrices.
Project Overview:    The Iris Flower Classification project aims to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset contains 150 samples with four features each: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# Features

Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Data Preprocessing: Standardization using StandardScaler

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

Visualization: Confusion Matrix Heatmap

# Results
Achieved an accuracy of [specific metric, e.g., 95%] on the test set.
